It was freed from Moorish domination back in 1148 after which the first king of Portugal embarked on a mammoth restoration project. Towers were rebuilt the little white houses were refurbished and soon the whole place was transformed. It certainly impressed King Dinis when he visited in 1282. He presented it to his new wife Queen Isabel as a wedding gift. And in the centuries that followed countless other monarchs did the same. Today it&#8217;s one of the prettiest towns in Portugal. Its chunky Medieval walls are topped off with towers and when you step inside you feel as if time stopped ticking centuries ago. Ancient narrow streets are lined with white-washed houses. Bougainvillea and honeysuckle drench the place in colour and scent. And tiny little shops sell all sorts of traditional crafts. Some lovely churches and chapels line your path but the real must-see is the castle. From the top the view is phenomenal. Think proud hills and sweeping valleys freckled with the occasional windmill. We&#8217;ll take you on a guided walking tour of this romantic city then you&#8217;ll get some free time to explore for yourself. You&#8217;ll soon see that as wedding gifts go Obidos takes some beating.

982481,80,Intro,In 79AD this remarkable aristocratic resort town was submerged under a torrent of mud and lava from the same eruption that destroyed Pompeii. Rediscovered by well-diggers in the 18th-century excavation continues to this day - a delicate operation as much of the site is covered by modern buildings. Herculaneum is smaller than Pompeii but its size and better preservation gives us a more immediate sense of the shape and ambience of a Roman town. While Pompeii was burned out with volcanic cinders the mud swamping Herculaneum covered the houses in a protective crust which kept upper storeys and even some of the woodwork and mosaics intact. Even a few of the gardens have been lovingly replanted.

Then all you have to do is press play and set off at your own pace &#8211; follow the suggested route or come up with your own.

It means you&#8217;ve got complete flexibility to do things the way that best suits you.

In every stone of its timeworn walls on every fresco painting and every hidden alley you&#8217;ll relive its glorious past. The old town centre is still really well preserved and the criss-crossed narrow streets and squares have monuments at every corner. From Prince&#8217;s Palace and Napoleon&#8217;s Theatre to the most recognisable symbol of the city - the Romanesque Cathedral of Saint Tryphon &#8211; you&#8217;ll be mesmerised from the word go. And how many towns in this part of the world have preserved their fortifications from the Middle Ages? Not many. But Kotor is one of the few. The chunky walls surrounding the old town are impressive to say the least - at some places they reach 20 metres in height and 16 metres in thickness. If you don&#8217;t believe us you&#8217;ll have plenty of time to measure them in the free time you&#8217;ll get here. Have we given you enough reasons to join our guided visit to Kotor? We think so.

981870,20,Unit Name,Discovery Walks - Rhodes
981870,80,Intro,The best way of getting to grips with a city is on foot especially when you&#8217;ve got a clued-up tour guide to give you the inside scoop on all the top attractions. That said it can be a bit frustrating having to stick to someone else&#8217;s schedule. The solution? Discovery Walks. On these tours you&#8217;ll be kitted out with your very own audio device like an iPod and a special customised map. Then all you have to do is press play and set off at your own pace &#8211; follow the suggested route or come up with your own. As you walk around the city the audio guide will tell you a bit about the sights you pass. The best bit is you can pause at any time and skip the bits you don&#8217;t want to see. It means you&#8217;ve got complete flexibility to do things the way that best suits you.

It means you&#8217;ve got complete flexibility to do things the way that best suits you.

Herculaneum is smaller than Pompeii but its size and better preservation gives us a more immediate sense of the shape and ambience of a Roman town. While Pompeii was burned out with volcanic cinders the mud swamping Herculaneum covered the houses in a protective crust which kept upper storeys and even some of the woodwork and mosaics intact. Even a few of the gardens have been lovingly replanted.

983161,80,Intro,If you think you&#8217;ve discovered all Naples has to offer think again. The Bourbon Tunnels are somewhat of a secret - even the entrance is hidden. Heading out on foot you&#8217;ll first discover what the city Naples has to offer. Like the guide books say it may not have the romance of Venice or the style of Rome but what it does have is bags of character. And your guide can&#8217;t wait to point the best bits out to you. From the Opera House to the wide open piazzas you&#8217;ll understand what we mean. After some little free time to explore yourself we&#8217;ll head under the streets. These tunnels were originally built as a military passage to connect the Royal Palace to the main street. But over the years they have been used to move water and a place of shelter during WWII. Exploring these surprisingly large tunnels is all the more exciting when you think of the bustling streets of Naples just above your head.
