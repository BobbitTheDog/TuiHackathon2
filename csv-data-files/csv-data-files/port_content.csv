Port Klang&#8217;s also a good jumping off point for visiting Klang. This town&#8217;s cut from a different cloth to super-modern Kuala Lumpur and instead serves up historic monuments temples and lively shopping streets. Kuala Lumpur itself is just over an hour&#8217;s drive away so it&#8217;s easy to pay the skyscraper-filled city a visit too.<ul><li>Head to Port Klang&#8217;s Bagan Hailam neighbourhood and you&#8217;ll find a big selection of restaurants propped up above the water. They dish up local favourites like salt-baked crab deep-fried squid and steamed crayfish.</li><li>Take a boat trip to Pulau Ketam for a seriously authentic experience. This island&#8217;s set just off the coast of Port Klang and all of the locals live in &#8216;floating&#8217; houses on stilts. It&#8217;s known for its fishing trade and the name even translates as &#8216;Crab Island&#8217;.</li><li>Treat yourself to a spot of retail therapy in Kuala Lumpur. Pavilion KL lines up luxury labels and Berjaya Times Square has 10 floors packed with shops restaurants and a cinema.</li></ul>

It&#8217;s set in the Lake of Kochi on Willingdon Island so the easiest way to travel to other parts of Kochi City from here is via a ferry.

L48490,90,Location name,Mormugao
L48490,2250,Intro - CRU,Docking in Mormugao puts you a hop skip and a jump away from some of Goa&#8217;s best bits. Within an hour&#8217;s drive you&#8217;ve got the state capital of Panjim the UNESCO-listed city of Old Goa and a clutch of beaches that boast powder-soft sand. The rest of the state acts as a bridge between eastern and western culture. Goa was a Portuguese colony for over 400 years and this is clear to see in its architecture. You can wander past crumbling European-style churches down to beaches that are lined with shacks cooking up spicy treats like Goan fish curry.<ul><li>Ramp your cooking knowledge up a notch by learning all about spices on a plantation tour.

L48492,90,Location name,Sir Bani Yas (Abu Dhabi)
L48492,2250,Intro - CRU,Sir Bani Yas is probably as close to a desert island as you can get. One with pale-sand beaches a former-palace-turned-hotel and a wildlife reserve that is. The tiny isle sits just 110 miles west of the UAE&#8217;s capital Abu Dhabi. And in a nation so known for its manmade marvels Sir Bani Yas bucks the trend. This place is all-natural. A wildlife park covers almost half of the island &#8211; here endangered Arabian oryx gazelles and ostriches roam free.<ul><li>You&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking you&#8217;re in Africa on an early morning game drive of the Arabian Wildlife Park. Giraffes cheetahs and hyenas are just some of the animals you can see.</li><li>Spot dugongs sea turtles and tropical fish on a snorkel around the island. They&#8217;re all occasional visitors to these shores but angelfish seahorse and starfish are sure bets.</li><li>Kayak through the island&#8217;s mangroves &#8211; keeping an eye out for birds feeding in the shallows. Non-indigenous flamingos for instance now call the island home.</li></ul>
001629,90,Location name,Naples (for Pompeii &amp; Capri)
001629,2250,Intro - CRU,Naples is Italy&#8217;s most red-blooded city. This is the place where the pizza is so good people don&#8217;t wait for their slices at restaurant tables they order it to-go from street side windows. And it&#8217;s the city where the soundtrack is the beeping of moped horns. For all its joy de vive you wouldn&#8217;t know Naples is actually one of the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in the world. The city centre is actually a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it&#8217;s dripping with ancient architecture cathedrals and churches.<br /><br />&#8226; Visit the time-frozen cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum whose citizens were stopped in their tracks by the famous eruptions of 79 AD.<br />&#8226; Call in at the cliff-top town of Sorrento. Pull up a chair on the cobbles of Piazza Tasso and sip a cappuccino in the sun.<br />&#8226; Teeter on the brink of Mount Vesuvius the only active volcano you can climb in Europe.<br />&#8226; Snake your way along the outrageously gorgeous Amalfi Coast and stop at the postcard-perfect fishing village of Positano or the working town of Amalfi.<br />&#8226; Hit the sleek boutiques of the jet-set isle of Capri.<br />&#8226; It&#8217;s true what the guide books say. Naples is chaotic. It&#8217;s got none of the romance of Venice. None of the style of Rome. But what it has got is bags of character. It&#8217;s an authentic slice of southern Italian life. Washing is strung out between buildings. A forest of skew-whiff TV aerials punctuates the skyline. And buzzing Vespas and honking Fiats weave manically through the streets. But it&#8217;s not all hustle and bustle. The city centre is packed with ornate palaces churches and monasteries including a 14th-century cathedral and a 13th-century fortress the Castel Nuovo. Don&#8217;t miss the Museo Archeologico Nazionale either &#8211; it&#8217;s one of the world&#8217;s most important archaeological museums and is literally stuffed-full of finds from nearby Pompeii and Herculaneum.
