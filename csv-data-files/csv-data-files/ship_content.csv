150013,40,Intro,In summer 2017 Marella Discovery 2 joined the Marella Cruises fleet. Marella Discovery 2 is the sister ship to Marella Discovery &#8211; and this is why their names are so similar. Having two ships means youre able to pair a wider choice of itineraries with the exciting features offered by this larger more contemporary style of vessel. These include an outdoor cinema a rock climbing wall a minigolf course an indoor pool and a glossy atrium. Not to mention the range of bars excellent dining scene and night-time shows enhanced by up-to-the-minute technology. Just like Marella Discovery Marella Discovery 2 will be All Inclusive as standard. So drinks including prosecco and cider meals in a selection of restaurants and most onboard activities are included in the cruise price. Flights and tips are both part of the package too.
