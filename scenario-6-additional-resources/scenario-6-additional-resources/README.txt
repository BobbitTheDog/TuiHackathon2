Scenario 6 - Additional Resources
=================================

In addition to the `csv-data-files.zip` you will need the files located under `level-1` and `level-2`.

In both cases simply substitute these files from the `csv-data-files.zip`:

  * distance_to_next_port.csv
  * port_of_call.csv

with those from either `level-1` or `level-2` as appropriate.

This will simulate the loss of port-of-call sequence for `level-1` and the loss of port-of-call sequence and the loss of distance to next port for `level-2`.

There are no additional resources required for `level-3`.
